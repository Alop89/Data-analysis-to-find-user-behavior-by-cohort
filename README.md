# Data-analysis-to-find-user-behavior-by-cohort
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of a company's data with the aim of obtaining valuable information about customer behavior and business profitability.
Specifically, it seeks to answer the following questions:

* Purchase patterns: At what point in the customer lifecycle do purchases begin? What factors influence the purchasing decision?

* User behavior: How do customers use the different services offered? What are the most valued features?

* Customer value: How much money does each customer contribute to the company throughout their relationship? How can customers be segmented based on their value?

* Acquisition efficiency: How long does it take for the company to recoup the costs of acquiring a new customer? What strategies could optimize this process?
