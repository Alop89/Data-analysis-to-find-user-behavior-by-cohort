# Data-analysis-to-find-user-behavior-by-cohort
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of a company's data with the aim of obtaining valuable information about customer behavior and business profitability.
Specifically, it seeks to answer the following questions:

* Purchase patterns: At what point in the customer lifecycle do purchases begin? What factors influence the purchasing decision?

* User behavior: How do customers use the different services offered? What are the most valued features?

* Customer value: How much money does each customer contribute to the company throughout their relationship? How can customers be segmented based on their value?

* Acquisition efficiency: How long does it take for the company to recoup the costs of acquiring a new customer? What strategies could optimize this process?

# Conclusions
Overall, the ROMI tends to increase over time for most cohorts. This indicates that returns on marketing investments accumulate favorably as customers continue to purchase in subsequent months after their first order.


The cohort of 2017-07-01 stands out for having a notable increase in its ROMI over time, especially between months 9 and 10, where the ROMI reaches values above 100. This suggests that the marketing campaigns in July 2017 were particularly effective, resulting in customers who generate high returns over time.

On the other hand, more recent cohorts, such as 2018-04-01 and 2018-05-01, have low initial ROMI values, and the accumulation is less visible due to the lack of data for subsequent months. It is necessary to wait longer to evaluate the full performance of these cohorts.



It is recommended to analyze in detail the marketing strategies implemented in July 2017 and June 2017 to replicate the key elements that contributed to its success in future campaigns.

The analysis shows a daily average of 907 visits and a monthly average of 23,228, with significant peaks in November and December, coinciding with Christmas shopping and effective marketing strategies. August records the lowest visits, probably due to vacations and less interest in online shopping. Session duration reveals high short-term engagement and long-term retention, with 97% of users making a purchase within six months. Initial cohorts show LTV growth, stabilizing afterwards, and the July 2017 campaigns stand out for their high ROMI. It is recommended to replicate these successful strategies and optimize the conversion funnel to improve retention and long-term performance.

In conclusion, the analysis of ROMI and web traffic metrics reveals a pattern of growth in the return on marketing investment over time, especially for older cohorts. This indicates that the implemented marketing strategies are generating long-term value, as acquired customers continue to make repeat purchases.

The marketing campaigns of July 2017 stand out as a success case, generating a significantly high ROMI and sustained growth over time. This suggests that the tactics employed in that period were particularly effective in attracting and retaining high-value customers.

The analysis of web traffic metrics confirms the influence of seasons and marketing campaigns on user behavior. The peaks in visits during the Christmas seasons and the low in August are consistent with expected market trends. The high conversion rate and session duration indicate a high level of engagement by users.

In summary, the results obtained support the effectiveness of the implemented marketing strategies. However, it is essential to continue monitoring the performance of the most recent cohorts and making adjustments to ongoing campaigns to optimize ROMI and ensure sustainable business growth.

It is recommended to:

Replicate the successful strategies of July 2017: Identify the key elements that contributed to the high ROMI of this cohort and apply them in future campaigns.
Optimize the conversion funnel: Focus on improving long-term customer retention and increasing customer lifetime value (LTV).
Continue monitoring metrics: Continuously track ROMI, web traffic, and other key metrics to evaluate campaign effectiveness and identify opportunities for improvement.
Segment the audience: Implement more precise segmentation strategies to personalize marketing campaigns and increase their effectiveness.
